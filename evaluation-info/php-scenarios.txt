This file lists php scenarios that might be suitable to use for evaluation for
SearchRepair as well as the tests that execute the method(s) modified by the
human in the associate bug-fixing patches.

Note that the listed tests are named as they are in the test.sh files associated
with each ManyBug scenario (for some reason they're in reverse numerical order,
but the order isn't important). It is possible to get from that test.sh file the
actual associated test command, with minimal work.  Since I don't know exactly
what you need or how you're running your experiments, I leave this to you (but
can offer pointers if necessary).  However, please note that each test.sh should
be assumed to be unique, so the numbers don't translate between scenarios, even
for the same program (like php).

I also did not collect the compilation flags for the modules under repair,
assuming that this was within your power.

I ran these within Docker images, taken from Chris.  They're a little bit buggy
right now (I had to add a line to prepare.sh for each scenario, for example, but
I think he's fixing that soon?) but overall it was very easy to do.
